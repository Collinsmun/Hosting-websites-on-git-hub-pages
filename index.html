            The great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), also known as the tiger owl (originally derived from early
             naturalists' description as the "winged tiger" or "tiger of the air"), or the hoot owl,[3] is a large 
             owl native to the Americas. It is an extremely adaptable bird with a vast range and is the most widely 
             distributed true owl in the Americas.
